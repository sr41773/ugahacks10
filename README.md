# MedElly  

## Get Your Memory Back with MedElly!  

**MedElly** is a **personalized music therapy platform** designed to help individuals **improve memory, alleviate stress, and enhance overall well-being** through **frequency-based music therapy**.  

By leveraging **Next.js, HPCC Systems, Auth0, and Howler.js**, we ensure a **secure, customizable, and immersive experience** for users. MedElly also fosters a **community-driven approach**, allowing users to connect through music that heals.

## 🚀 Inspiration  
Research suggests that listening to music from one's youth **triggers memory recall, reduces stress, and supports cognitive function**, particularly for individuals with **Alzheimer’s and dementia**. Studies have also shown that **specific frequencies (e.g., 432Hz)** can have therapeutic effects, further reinforcing the power of **music therapy**.  

During **UGAHacks**, our team was inspired to make **music therapy accessible to everyone** through a **web-based platform** where users can input their mental health concerns and receive **personalized therapeutic music recommendations**.

## 💡 Challenges We Faced  

1. **HPCC & Pinata Integration** – Understanding how to incorporate **HPCC’s datasets** and **Pinata’s file uploading system** into our project.  
   - _Solution:_ Our team split up to attend the HPCC and Pinata workshops, which helped us brainstorm integration ideas.  
2. **Auth0 Setup** – We encountered multiple **hydration errors and login URL issues**.  
   - _Solution:_ We relied on YouTube tutorials and documentation to troubleshoot the implementation.  
3. **Git Collaboration Issues** – We faced **push conflicts, large file issues, and missing files** across our team.  
   - _Solution:_ We adapted by using **file-sharing methods** like email and zip folders for critical components.  
4. **Web Audio API & Howler.js** – Initially, our **MP3 files would not load** or play in the web app.  
   - _Solution:_ We discovered that the **public folder in Next.js doesn’t require explicit pathing** and used **Howler.js** for audio management.
